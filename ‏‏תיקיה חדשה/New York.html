                            Towering over Manhattan's skyscrapers, the Empire State Building is a landmark in New York and has been featured in many films and TV shows. The observation deck on the top floor, accessible by high-speed elevators, offers a panoramic view of New York's cityscape, taking in views of both the Hudson River and the East River. The view is even more magnificent at sunset and particularly charming inundated in lights at nightfall. The Empire State Building offers multimedia devices as guidance, introducing New York's major tourist attractions in each direction. Telescopes mounted on the observation deck provide an even better view.

                            Set on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, the Statue of Liberty is arguably the symbol of New York City. Originally a gift from France to commemorate the centenary of US independence, it stood as a beacon welcoming generations of immigrants into the United States when nearby Ellis Island was the nation's primary port of entry. Reproduced countless times around the world in struggles for liberty and justice, the Statue of Liberty is a potent reminder of the power of ideas and the foundational myths in US history. Visitors can tour Liberty Island and ascend into the statue provided it is not closed for security or repair. Many people enjoy the free trip on the Staten Island Ferry, which passes near Liberty Island and allows one to imagine what it must have been like sailing into New York Harbor for the first time.

                            Central Park is located in the middle of Manhattan's urban forest of skyscrapers. Like an oasis in the desert, this is an refuge of green calm in the middle of the bustling metropolis. The park is dotted with many lakes and stands of trees both large and small. There are walking paths, running trails, bicycle paths, a zoo, sports fields and children's rides. You can stretch out on the lawn and enjoy the warm sunlight, stroll along while eating a hot dog, or go to the John Lennon Memorial - Strawberry Fields. This is a great way to enjoy a quiet and relaxing moment in the busy city.
