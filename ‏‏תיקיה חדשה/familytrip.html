    <h3>
        The best family vacations take everybody's priorities into account: Mom and Dad want to relax, the kids want to swim,
        everyone wants to spend quality time together,
        and nobody wants to be bored. With that in mind, your whole family can get behind these family vacation destinations,
        which are geared towards families who are traveling with kids.
        Not every family likes the same things, though, so we had to search far and wide to find destinations to suit your every taste.
        Whether it’s beach towns, sleepaway camp-like wooded terrain, Caribbean getaways,or dude ranches you're after,
        there’s a vacation in here for you — it doesn't matter whether your idea of fun is an all-inclusive resort
        or a houseboat that you steer down the waters yourself.
        (And, if it’s always been your dream to stay in a treehouse, read on!) Once you get to whatever destination you choose,
        you and you family can load up your days with scenic hikes, record-breaking water slides, kid-friendly golf courses,
        and — shhh! —even a winery for your vacation-from-your-vacation.
        (Get a sitter for the kids.) The children will be happy,
        which makes Mom and Dad happy, and you just might find a place you’ll want to visit and re-visit these places again and again.

            Kids will love the water park (complete with daily "mass sliming" events),
            character interactions (SpongeBob! The Ninja Turtles!), and kids' clubs at the Nickelodeon Hotels & Resorts Punta Cana.
            You'll love that it's all inclusive — gourmet meals, drinks, and sports club,
            too — so you don't have to waste family bonding time adding up the cost of every activity in your head.
            And if you want to be a frequent traveler, another Nickelodeon Hotels & Resorts location is scheduled to open in Riviera Maya, Mexico in 2020.

            There's no bad time to visit this Poconos Mountains retreat: In the summer, you can head outdoors for ziplines,
            go-carts, and swimming (indoors or outdoors), while in the winter, you can do snow-tubing and ice skating.
            There are even escape rooms you can try with your family, if you dare.
            (Note: Some of these activities are only available with an extra fee.) Each day, there are more than 30 activities scheduled, so you'll never have a dull moment.

            There's a good reason the Bahamas are such a popular family vacation destination: You'll find white sand beaches,
            crystal blue surf, and plenty of family-friendly activities, all located just 181 miles from Miami.
            Baha Mar, a collection of three resorts (Rosewood Baha Mar, SLS Baha Mar, and the Grand Hyatt Baha Mar),
            is just a 10 minute drive from Nassau's main airport.
            The resort's Explorers Club, open 9 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.,
            offers kids ages 3 to 12 the chance to enjoy a variety of exciting adventures and games
            (and gives adults the time to enjoy some games of their own at the resort's casino).
            Kids will also love diving into Dean's Blue Hole, the most unique of the resort's 11 pools, featuring rock walls,
            waterfalls, and a grotto that looks directly into The Sanctuary, a marine conservation area filled with nurse sharks,
            sea turtles, tropical fish, sting rays, and more.

            Just outside of Austin, TX, on the shores of Lake Travis, is this Texas Hill Country resort.
            There are three big swimming pools, but you'll probably spend most of your time at the one with the big Adventure Waterslide.
            If you want to get out on the lake, you can rent boats, jet skis, or pontoons.
            There's also a huge Kids Zone that younger ones will flip for because, in addition to the requisite ping-pong tables and basketball hoops,
            this one has bounce houses. (While they're bouncing, you can hit up the spa.)
