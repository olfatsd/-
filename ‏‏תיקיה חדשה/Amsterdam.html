                            The total length of the canals in Amsterdam is more than a hundred kilometers, with numerous islands and bridges, making the city known as the “Venice of the North”. There are thousands of "boat houses" on the river, although they are houseboats but fully equipped. You can truly appreciate the unique charm of the water city by visiting Amsterdam by glass boat. Cruises pass through the famous river course, which is lined with typical Dutch traditional houses.

                            Located in the heart of Amsterdam, Dam Square is known as the “navel” and is a landmark in Amsterdam. There are a variety of cafes, restaurants and bars on Dam Square. The majestic buildings around Dam Square are also worth a visit. The imposing blue-top building on the west side of the square is the Royal Palace of Amsterdam. It is now used as a venue for the reception of the royal family and the new king's succession ceremony. The steeple Gothic church adjacent to the Royal Palace is a new church, which usually hosts organ concerts and exhibitions. To the south of the square is the famous Madame Tussauds, from which the huge round glass overlooks the entire Dam Square.
