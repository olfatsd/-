    <h2>About Sao Paulo :-</h2>
    <div>

        <p>
            São Paulo and Rio couldn’t be any more different. Rio is hot, sexy and chaotic, knew for its sultry beaches and passionate samba. In São Paulo, residents of the seventh largest city in the world are more often than not found working, partly to maintain its distinction as the world's tenth richest city. That money gets a lot of impressive buildings, and visitors will appreciate the 70 shopping malls and dozens of business hotels that fill the Brazilian modernist architectural gems. As the cultural capital of Brazil, São Paulo boasts South America's most impressive collection of nightclubs, museums and theatres. The city is also South America's most gay-friendly; its Gay Pride Parade in October is the largest in the world, been recognized for draw up to 3 million folks. Dining tops most Paulistanos lists of things to do, as São Paulo has the best restaurant selection in the country, ranging from sushi to Brazilian chiropractor (steakhouses). São Paulo has the largest population of Italian descendants outside of Italy (six million), so try the famed pizza partisan.

It was built in 1913 and the construction lasted for 40 years, becoming a luxurious project in São Paulo's 400th anniversary. In terms of artistic features, it blends Gothic and Renaissance styles. In addition to the Gothic spires, the Cathedral's semi-circular arch vouchers and the Center are in the Renaissance style. The designer imitates Florence's Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore.

                            Oriental Street, also known as the Free Zone, has a distinctive oriental culture. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Brazilian government attracted a large number of laborers from Asia through corresponding policies, an important part of which was immigrants from Japan. These immigrants are now gathered in Oriental Street of Sao Paulo. From the banks of the street to the shrines in the depths, all of them are Japanese-style, and even the street lights have integrated the elements of the torii. In addition to Japanese descendants, there are many descendants of Chinese and Koreans living in this neighborhood, and there are many Chinese-run restaurants, shops and travel agencies.
