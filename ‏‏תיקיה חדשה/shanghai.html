    <h2>About shanghai :-</h2>
    <div>

        <p>
            In Shanghai, known as the “Paris of the East,” the cultures from East and West are intertwined to create the city’s cosmopolitan style. What was once the ten-mile Shanghai International Settlement, established by the British in conjunction with Americans and French living along the Huangpu River in present-day Puxi, the metropolis currently develops and changes every day. There are historical and cultural architectural wonders lining the Bund and Xintiandi, as well as fashionable attractions in Pudong, such as the Oriental Pearl TV Tower and Shanghai Disneyland Resort. Young creative souls can go to the Former French Concession’s Tianzifang and 1933 Laoyangfang (a former slaughterhouse turned into unique shops and art galleries) to experience what the area was once like centuries ago. The fashionable can walk up and down Nanjing Xi Shopping Street to their hearts’ content. Foodies can go to the Chenghuang (City God) Temple in the Yu Garden complex to try Shanghai delicacies.
            Shanghai is a multifaceted place no one will regret visiting.

                            The Oriental Pearl Radio & Television Tower is arguably the most recognizable feature on Shanghai’s skyline.
                            Situated across the Huangpu River from the Bund, the Oriental Pearl tower stands 468 m to the top of its antenna spire.
                            Completed in 1994, it has come to symbolize China’s modernization and emergence on the global scene.
                            Visitors travel up and down the Oriental Pearl Tower in double-decker elevators that can hold up to fifty people.
                            Located on the tower’s lower levels is the Shanghai Municipal History Museum.
                            Given its iconic status, this is certainly a can’t-miss attraction.

                            Arguably Shanghai's most-famous tourist attraction, the Bund is a waterfront promenade and famous business district in central Shanghai.
                            Historically, the Bund was the city’s main financial and trading center,
                            and was located within the Shanghai International Settlement, an area under nominal British control between 1843 and 1941.
                            The walking areas extend roughly 1.6 km along the west bank of the Huangpu River. Owing to its historic status and zoning restrictions, the Bund contains fantastic examples of classic Shanghai architecture. For this reason, it is a popular spot for photography,
                            offering the best views across the river to Shanghai’s modern skyline in Lujiazui. No visit to Shanghai would be complete without a visit to the Bund.
