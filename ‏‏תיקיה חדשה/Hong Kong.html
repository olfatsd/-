        <div>

            <p>
                Hong Kong, also known as the “Pearl of the Orient”, is a very distinctive city.
                The city is very prosperous and culturally rich, highlighting both tradition and forward thinking.
                There are many business districts on both sides of Victoria Harbour, a favorite of tourists looking for a rich shopping experience, while the Star Ferry running across the harbor between Kowloon and Hong Kong Island has been operating for over a hundred years. Hong Kong is also home to the first Disneyland in China, countless delicious eateries and a unique tea shop culture. The city is like a sediment of history being slowly carried forward by the currents of time.
                Hong Kong films were once a characteristic calling card of the city during their heyday, telling countless stories unique to the Hong Kong cityscape.

                                The heritage of the Walt Disney Company is alive and well at Hong Kong Disneyland. Different from any other Disney property on the planet,
                                Hong Kong Disneyland Resort prides itself on offering a diverse and culturally distinctive Disney experience for guests of all ages.
                                The park is divided into several "lands" (themed areas). These include Adventureland, Grizzly Gulch, and Toy Story Land. Throughout the park there are countless restaurants and shops.
                                Disney strives to have something for everyone and it is little wonder why this is one of the most popular attractions in Hong Kong.

                                Standing at 552 m, Victoria Peak is the highest hill on Hong Kong Island. From the summit area, you can enjoy a stunning panoramic view. The public walking paths around the peak offer excellent vantage points for photographing Victoria Harbor and the marvelous Hong Kong skyline. It's possible to reach Victoria Peak by bus or via the historic cable car. There are stores and restaurants located in the Peak Galleria. Visiting at sunset or at night is simply spectacular. There is arguably no better place from which to glimpse central Hong Kong

                                Victoria Harbour is a natural landform harbor separating Hong Kong Island in the south from Kowloon on the mainland to the north. The harbor's deep, sheltered waters and strategic location on the South China Sea were instrumental in Hong Kong's establishment as a British colony and its subsequent development as a trading center. The harbor is a major tourist attraction. Lying in the middle of the territory's dense urban region, it is the site of annual fireworks displays and its promenades are used as gathering places for tourists and residents. The best place for pictures is the Kowloon side from where you can look across the harbor to Hong Kong Island.
