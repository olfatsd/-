    <h2>About London :-</h2>
    <div>

        <p>
            As the capital of the United Kingdom, London bears much of Great Britain’s glory, and it is here that the traditional British ambiance is both deeply rooted and carried forth. The lofty figures of the imposing Parliament Building and London Tower Bridge are landmarks of London, and you can easily view this classical architecture by taking a tourist boat along the Thames River. At the same time, as one of the world's three major financial centers and a place where all cultures of the world gather together, London is also rapidly modernizing. There are art galleries and a forest of skyscrapers, and riding up on the London Eye, which symbolized the new millennium, you can enjoy London's beautiful skyline!

                            The British Museum is one of the three greatest museums in the world. It features a rich collection of rare works. The museum was the first to display the Rosetta Stone in its Egyptian Hall. The stone stele is inscribed with a decree in three different languages, and was the invaluable key to understanding language and culture in ancient Egypt. In addition, there are more than 23,000 Chinese relics housed here, the likes of which are rare even in Beijing’s Forbidden City or the National Palace Museum in Taipei.

                            The London Eye is also known as the Millennium Wheel and was built to usher in the new millennium. This giant ferris wheel sits on the South Bank of the River Thames and has become one of the London skyline's landmarks. It is currently the most popular tourist attraction in London, hosting over 3.75 million visitors every year. Sitting in a capsule on the London Eye, visitors enjoy a bird’s-eye view of the city of London spread out below. Once night begins to fall, the area surrounding the Eye transforms into a fantastical dreamscape. Taking a ride in the London Eye at sunset paints an unforgettable picture of the gorgeous city.

                            Buckingham Palace has been the official residence of the British royal family since the 19th century. Currently, it is the London location in which the Queen spends most of her time. The palace is splendid both inside and outside. Some of the more than 600 rooms in the palace include the Throne Room, White Drawing Room, Ballroom and Picture Gallery. At the gates of Buckingham Palace, the Changing the Guard (or Guard Mounting) ceremony by the Queen's Guard takes place at 11 a.m. most days of the week. It attracts and interests tourists from around the world. Marching with great pomp and precision to military music and shouted orders, the guards—dressed in traditional red coats and bearskin hats—do a drill performance and salute.

                            The London Tower Bridge is one of London's iconic landmark structures. It is a bascule and suspension bridge that crosses the mighty Thames. It is also a drawbridge. The two bascules can lift to an angle of 86 degrees to let river traffic to pass. On a visit to the The London Tower Bridge, you can stand with the Thames at your back for an unforgettable photo, or you can slowly stroll along the bridge's high-level pedestrian walkways while gazing out at the scenery on either bank of the river.
