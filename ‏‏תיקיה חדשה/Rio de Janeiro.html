    <h2>About Rio de Janeiro :-</h2>
    <div>

        <p>
            Affectionately knew as the "Marvelous city" among locals, Rio de Janeiro is indeed a spectacular sight to behold. Founded in 1565, Rio has risen to become one of the most famous cities in Brazil, and was in fact the capital of this far reaching country up until 1960. There are a lot of iconic features associated with Rio, of which the Christ The Redeemer statue perched overlooking the city might be the most striking. Another popular Rio feature, is the annual Carnival celebration. One of the biggest and most eccentric parties the world over, Carnival is just before Lent, and is tolerated by the within the Roman Catholic Church as a get-it-all-out-of-your-system new party. The natural landscape around Rio is spectacular, with numerous peaks surrounding their unique harbor helping it to land a spot on the list of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World. There are dozens of historic and modern attractions throughout the city, although it's still advisable to steer clear of the faults, or slums. Still, if you are looking for fun and excitement, this city is part of the best such options in all of South America.

                            Located on the east side of the Chijuca National Forest, Jesus Mountain was built to commemorate the success of the Brazilian independence movement. From a distance, it seems to welcome and embrace people coming to Brazil. When the weather is fine during the day, you can see the image of Jesus in any corner of Rio. When the night falls, the white light on the image of Jesus will match the urban landscape of the mountain, which is psychedelic and solemn.

                            Sugarloaf Mountain is located at the mouth of Guanabara Bay. It consists of two hills. Because it looks like a mold for making bread, it is the name of Sugarloaf Mountain. It is a famous Rio sight the same as Mount Jesus. From here, overlooking the city, you can see the Monte Cristo, Rodrigues Atoll and Copacabana Beach from the top of the mountain. It is said that Sugar Loaf Mountain is still a place with a very high rate of marriage proposals.

                            Rio de Janeiro Cathedral is a church that differs from the traditional concept of Rio de Janeiro. Unlike the old and elegant churches in Europe, the entire church can hardly find any elements the belong to the church. It is a modern building with a reinforced concrete structure. There is a cross at the top of the tower. It is this simple cross that seems to confirm the identity of the church.
