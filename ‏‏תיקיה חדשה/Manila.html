        <h2>About Manila :-</h2>
        <div>

            <p>
                Manila is the capital city of the Philippines. New and old are interwoven with each other in this city which integrates eastern and western culture. Because it was once ruled by Spain, this place has quite the southwestern European atmosphere. Manila has a forest of skyscrapers. Its many streets and churches hold a hundred years of history, as well as gardens, alleys and byways full of blooming flowers. Downtown Manila is an excellent place to appreciate the city’s Spanish style. The Manila Cathedral, or Minor Basilica and Metropolitan Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, San Augustin Church and the Casa Manila museum are all located in the city. You can take a horse-drawn carriage tour around to visit them. Manila Bay, especially the waterfront Roxas Boulevard, is a beautiful place from which to watch the sunset. You also visit some places in the suburban outskirts of Manila, such as Tagatai to hike up the volcano or Pagsanjan to take part in exciting activities like rafting.
