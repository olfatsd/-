    <h2>About Phuket :-</h2>
    <div>

        <p>
            The wide, beautiful beaches, white sands and emerald waters make Phuket the “Pearl” of the Andaman Sea. The zig-zagging west coast is dotted with three major beaches, Patong, Karon and Hat Kata, the main destinations for most tourists. The island is characterized by colorful entertainment experiences and rich nightlife. If partying isn’t quite your thing, you might choose to take a visit to Kamala Beach, famous for its cleanliness, or even Hat Surin for its privacy. An established tourist island, facilities and resorts are already quite developed, making this coastal village a delight to visitors both young and old.

                            Located on the west coast of Phuket, about 15 kilometers from Phuket Town, Patong Beach is very lively. Its overall shape is like a horseshoe. The beach sand is soft, the water is clear and the waves are small. You can rent a chaise longue on the beach to watch the sea, experience a variety of exciting water sports, and enjoy the delicious seafood in the stalls. In addition to the lively beach, the beach roads on Patong are home to most of Phuket's hotels, resorts, shopping malls, restaurants and a lot of entertainment and business facilities that will definitely make you feel interesting at night. When night falls, Bangla Street, illuminated by neon lights, is rather beautiful.

                            Phuket FantaSea is a Las Vegas-style theme park located on the Gold Coast of Kamala. It is famous for its colorful nightlife and is also a popular tourist spot in Phuket. Unlike other theme parks which have mechanical facilities, Phuket FantaSea is based on the theme of Thai culture. Its selling points are a giant buffet restaurant and cabaret shows. The Thai people regard it as their local Disneyland. Every night, Phuket FantaSea will have exciting performance programs such as song and dance, magic show, acrobatics and elephant performance, giving people a deeper understanding of Thai culture.

                            Karon Beach is located on the west coast of Phuket, south of Patong and north of Kata. Karon and these two beaches are known as the three major beaches of Phuket. Compared to Patong Beach, the coastline here is longer and wider, the water is clearer, the beach is softer, and there are fewer tourists. On this coastline of nearly 4 km, you can enjoy a view of the sea while walking. The location is lovely. The beach provides a beautiful view of the sea, but it has large waves, so be careful when swimming.

                            As a veteran ladyboy show in Phuket, the Simon Cabaret has evolved into a professional entertainment venue in Phuket since its 1991 opening. The content of its show is healthy and interesting, the scale of the performances is large, and the elements of China, India, Egypt, Europe, America, Africa and other countries and regions are integrated. There are also up-to-date song and dance programs. The charm, beauty, talent, versatility, temperament and grace of the ladyboys are so expressive that put many women to shame.
