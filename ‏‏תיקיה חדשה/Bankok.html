                            Located in the heart of Bangkok, the Grand Palace is close to the Chao Phraya River and is a symbol of the Bangkok dynasty.
                            It is also the first choice for tourists to go to Thailand.
                            It is the royal palace of the first to eighth Thai emperors of the Bangkok dynasty and still used for ceremonies such as coronation and celebration.
                            The Grand Palace comprises intermingled building groups totaling 22. The main building group has 4 distinctive palaces and the Jade Buddha Temple.
                            Buildings are in Siamese style and bring together the best of Thai painting, sculpture and decorative art.

                            Wat Phra Kaew, or the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, is located in the northeast corner of the Grand Palace in Bangkok.
                            The temple is a must-see site for Thai tourists.
                            The royal family has held important ceremonies here. In Buddhist countries like Thailand, religion has always been inseparable from the monarchy. The Temple of the Emerald Buddha is also part of the Grand Palace and a vaunted representative of temples in Thailand. The Temple of the Emerald Buddha occupies a quarter of the Grand Palace. The architecture of the temple is magnificent, the statue of Buddha is adorned with gold, jade, and jewels, and the temple combines many characteristics of Buddhist temples in Thailand.
                            The architecture of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha includes fearsome guardians, the rare jade statue of Buddha, and a towering chedi. This temple is a Bangkok icon.

                            The Four-Faced Buddha in Bangkok,
                            Thailand, is known for its efficacy.
                            For this reason, the Buddha is widely admired and highly sought after by the stars and celebrities of Hong Kong and Taiwan.
                            Because it is located near large shopping malls like the Central World, it has also become a famous tourist attraction in Bangkok.
                            In Thailand and Southeast Asia, the Four-Faced Buddha is considered a benevolent god.
                            The Four-faced Buddha in Bangkok is in the Erawan Shrine amd the statue of the god is about 4 meters high.

                            There are four faces altogether, which represent the four virtues of compassion, empathy, joy and charity.
                            Those who pray for spiritual ascension must work hard to cultivate these four virtues.

                            Wat Arun is a prominent Buddhist temple located along the banks of the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok Yai District.
                            It is one of the few temples that remain from Thailand’s Chakri dynasty.
                            The temple’s most distinctive feature is the central Khmer-style tower.
                            Glazed porcelain tiles and seashells cover the exterior, giving the entire complex a brilliant shine, particularly in the early morning light.
                            For many years Wat Arun housed the famous Emerald Buddha, before it was moved to Wat Phra Kaew in 1785. As one of Bangkok’s beloved temples, this is certainly an attraction visitors won’t want to miss.
