            Sydney is the capital city of New South Wales. The city is wrapped around the beautiful and iconic Sydney Harbour. This is one of Australia's oldest, biggest and most diverse cities. From the center of downtown out to the suburbs, there is an endless array of charming and interesting things to see. The dazzling sites of Darling Harbour and the Sydney Harbour Bridge complement each other. The historic city center is a fascinating place to spend the day. The many beaches surrounding the city and Blue Mountains National Park—a World Heritage Site—are great places to either relax or be active.

                            The Sydney Fish Market is a combined wholesale, retail and catering market. If you are a seafood lover, the Sydney Fish Market is definitely a must for Sydney. There is a variety of seafood from Australia and abroad: huge Australian lobster, king crab, oysters, salmon, squid and more. Many seafood stores sell already processed seafood, or you can have it processed in other locations within the market which should be less expensive and very fresh. In addition to trying delicious food in a restaurant, you can take it outside and enjoy a delicious picnic.

                            The Sydney Opera House is a symbol of Australia. It is recognized as one of the Seven Wonders of the 20th Century and is also a landmark in Sydney. Its white exterior, a shell-like sculpture built on the harbour, like scattered petals floating in the air, have for many years left observers in amazement. It houses a concert hall, a music theatre, a performance theatre, a children's theatre and a photography studio. Auctions, concerts and other events are held every month or even every week.

                            The Sydney Harbour Bridge is construction representative of early Sydney. It is like a long rainbow across the bay, facing the world-famous Sydney Opera House across the sea, becoming a symbol of Sydney. Built in 1932, the Sydney Harbour Bridge has a total length of 1,149 meters, a width of 139 meters and a commanding height of 503 meters. It is a world famous steel arch bridge. Now climbing the Sydney Bridge has become Sydney's more popular tourist attraction, and it is one of the few bridges in the world that allows visitors to climb to the top of the arch. In addition to climbing, you can also drive under the bridge, take the train through the bridge or sail under the bridge, but the fullest experience is had by walking the bridge.
