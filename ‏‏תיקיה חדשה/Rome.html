    <h2>About Rome :-</h2>
    <div>

        <p>
            Rome is Italy's capital city and, in classical antiquity, the center of the Roman Empire. Because of the city's long and storied history, it is known as the "Eternal City". Presently, Rome has become a large "open-air history museum". Inside the city, many traces of ancient Rome have been preserved. You can go to the Colosseum—one of the symbols of the powerful ancient Roman Empire. At the Roman Forum, you will be shocked and amazed by the prosperity of the ancient imperial world. The Pantheon is a place where you can see architectural miracles constructed over 1,000 years ago. Within the city of Rome, there is also a country within a country—Vatican City. This is a place where you can experience the ultimate in Christian religious art and see many masterpieces left behind by Renaissance masters.

                            The Colosseum may be the most famous landmark in all of Rome. It was built in 80 AD and was once the site of many gladiator battles to the death, and prisoners fended off hungry lions. The Colosseum consists of four floors in total (including the basement), however only part of the ground floor and second floor are currently open to the public. The first floor offers a view of the maze-like buildings in the center of the Colosseum that were once part of the basement of the structure. They were once the homes of the beasts and gladiators that would be made to fight for the entertainment of the crowds. From the second floor, one can see the interior structure of the Colosseum which is divided into three parts: the arena, the auditorium and the podium. It is also a perfect location for taking unforgettable photos.

                            Trevi Fountain is also called the "Maiden's Fountain". Actually, most people prefer to call it the "Wishing Well". It is one of the most exquisitely carved works of art in Rome, and a must-see for all visitors. The image of the seahorse in the fountain sculpture is vivid. It's violent expression symbolizes the vagaries of the ocean, and the fantasy of fate. People come here and use their left hands to throw coins over their right shoulders. This is done to show you will return to Rome and find romance. Whether this superstition is true or not, the coin throwing has already become inextricably linked with the fountain. Everyone loves to take pictures of themselves making a wish.

                            Located in the heart of Rome, the Pantheon is a well-preserved imperial Roman building in the city. Michelangelo admiringly referred to it as “the design of the angels”. The Pantheon has over 2000 years of history and was once used to worship the Gods on Mt. Olympus. Famous historical figures, including Raphael and Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, have slept here. To witness the true mystique of the Pantheon, come here on a sunny day. As the sunlight shines through the windows, the bent light rays form magnificent columns of light that shimmer in all different colors, as if blessed by God.

                            Built in the 7th century BC, the Roman Forum was originally the burial ground of the Etruscans and later expanded into the heart of the Roman Republic. After the 4th century AD, the important position of the Roman Forum was gradually lost until it became a pasture, and a large amount of stone and marble were stolen for the construction of new palaces, churches and monuments. During the Renaissance, people rekindled old love for all classical things, and the square became the focus of attention of artists and architects. Beginning in the 18th century, people began systematically excavating the ruins of the square.
